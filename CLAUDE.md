# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`aggregate` is a Python actuarial library for building fast, accurate compound (aggregate) probability distributions — the sum of a random number of random variables. It targets insurance pricing, capital allocation, reinsurance analysis, and portfolio risk management. The core insight is delivering simulation-like accuracy at parametric distribution speed via FFT-based convolution.

## Commands

Use `uv` for all environment and dependency management.

**Sync environment:**
```
uv sync
```

**Install with dev extras:**
```
uv sync --extra dev
```

**Run anything in the managed environment:**
```
uv run python ...
uv run jupyter notebook
```

**Run the interpreter test suite** (primary test mechanism — no pytest):
```
uv run python -m aggregate.extensions.test_suite
```
This reads `aggregate/agg/test_suite.agg` (500+ DecL examples), builds all objects, and generates an HTML report.

**Build documentation:**
```
cd docs && uv run make.bat html          # Windows
cd docs && uv run make html              # Unix
```

**Quick interactive smoke test** (Python/Jupyter):
```python
from aggregate import build, qd
a = build('agg Dice dfreq [3] dsev [1:6]')
qd(a)
```

## Architecture

### Core class hierarchy

```
Frequency          ← base class for frequency distributions
  └── Aggregate    ← compound distribution (frequency × severity)
        └── Portfolio  ← collection of Aggregate units
```

`Severity` is a standalone wrapper around `scipy.stats` continuous RVs and discrete empirical distributions, with support for layers, limits, and spliced forms. `Aggregate` combines a `Frequency` and one or more `Severity` objects via FFT convolution.

### Key modules

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `distributions.py` | `Frequency`, `Aggregate`, `Severity` — the computational core |
| `portfolio.py` | `Portfolio` — multi-unit analysis, diversification, capital allocation |
| `spectral.py` | `Distortion` — risk measures (TVaR, Wang, PH, biTVaR, etc.) |
| `underwriter.py` | `Underwriter` — knowledge base, persistence, top-level `build()` entry point |
| `parser.py` | `UnderwritingLexer` / `UnderwritingParser` — DecL lexer/parser using bundled SLY |
| `utilities.py` | FFT helpers, quantile/TVaR functions, plotting, moment utilities |
| `bounds.py` | `Bounds` — pricing bounds (IME 2022 methodology) |
| `constants.py` | Global constants and validation flag definitions |

`aggregate/sly/` is a vendored copy of Dave Beazley's SLY lexer/parser library (vendored because SLY no longer publishes installable releases).

`aggregate/extensions/` contains optional modules (case studies, figures, the test suite runner, Fourier tools, Tweedie distributions). These are not imported by the core package.

### DecL — the domain-specific language

Users declare aggregates in a concise DSL. Example:
```
agg MyBook
    100 claims                     # expected claim count
    sev lognorm 100 cv 2           # lognormal severity, mean 100, CV 2
    occurrence net of 50 xs 0      # per-occurrence reinsurance
```

`build('...')` is the primary public API — it parses DecL and returns an `Aggregate` or `Portfolio`. The full grammar is in `parser.py`; reference examples are in `aggregate/agg/test_suite.agg`.

### Computation pattern

1. Severity distribution → discretized PMF on a fixed grid (`bs` = bucket size, `log2` = log₂ of grid points)
2. Frequency distribution → PGF (probability generating function)
3. FFT of severity PMF → raised to PGF power → inverse FFT → aggregate PMF
4. All risk measures (quantiles, TVaR, distortion premiums, allocations) computed from this PMF

Aliasing/moment-matching validation is controlled by flags in `constants.py` and reported via `explain_validation()`.

### numba

`utilities.py` has optional numba-compiled paths for TVaR and biTVaR inner loops. Numba is not required (pure-numpy fallbacks exist); it was removed as a hard dependency in 0.27.

## Documentation and docstrings

All new functions and any modified existing functions must include a docstring. The project uses NumPy-style docstrings (Parameters / Returns / Notes sections). For non-trivial mathematical logic, the Notes section should explain the algorithm or formula — this is an actuarial library where the "why" is often as important as the "what". Inline comments are appropriate for non-obvious numpy/FFT operations.

## Testing

There is no pytest suite. Integration testing is done through the interpreter test suite (`aggregate/extensions/test_suite.py`) which exercises the full DecL → build → statistics pipeline. The `.agg` file categories A–O cover frequencies, severities, reinsurance, distortions, case studies, and papers.

Validation failures surface as warnings via `explain_validation()`; numerical issues (aliasing, CV mismatch, skewness) set flags in `constants.py`.

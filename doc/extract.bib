@article{Anderson1988,
 abstract = {In recent years catastrophe reinsurers' use of catastrophe models has been increasing until currently virtually all of the catastrophe reinsurers in the world use a catastrophe model to aid them in their pricing and portfolio management decisions. This paper explicitly models various types of reinstatement provisions, including reinstatements that are limited by the number of occurrences and by the aggregate losses; and reinstatement premiums based on the size of loss and by the time elapsed to the first occurrence. The paper also investigates the effects on the fair premium of a catastrophe treaty when various reinstatement provisions are considered. This is an expansion of the methods developed in papers by Leroy J. Simon and Bjom Sundt, which were written before the widespread use of catastrophe models. The catastrophe model used for this paper is the Insurance / Investment Risk Assessment System (IRAS) produced by Risk Management Solutions, Inc.},

 abstract = {Existing risk capital allocation methods, such as the Euler rule, work under the explicit assumption that portfolios are formed as linear combinations of random loss/profit variables, with the firm being able to choose the portfolio weights. This assumption is unrealistic in an insurance context, where arbitrary scaling of risks is generally not possible. Here, we model risks as being partially generated by L{\'{e}}vy processes, capturing the non-linear aggregation of risk. The model leads to non-homogeneous fuzzy games, for which the Euler rule is not applicable. For such games, we seek capital allocations that are in the core, that is, do not provide incentives for splitting portfolios. We show that the Euler rule of an auxiliary linearised fuzzy game (non-uniquely) satisfies the core property and, thus, provides a plausible and easily implemented capital allocation. In contrast, the Aumann–Shapley allocation does not generally belong to the core. For the non-homogeneous fuzzy games studied, Tasche's (1999) criterion of suitability for performance measurement is adapted and it is shown that the proposed allocation method gives appropriate signals for improving the portfolio underwriting profit.},

In our setting, transaction costs may be random, time-dependent, have jumps and the preferences of the agents are modeled by multivariate expected utility functions. We provide a complete characterization of efficient portfolios, generalizing earlier results of Dybvig (Rev Financ Stud 1:67-88, 1988) and Jouini and Kallal (J Econ Theory 66: 178-197, 1995). We basically show that a portfolio is efficient if and only if it is cyclically anticomonotonic with respect to at least one consistent price system that prices it. Finally, we introduce the notion of utility price of a given contingent claim as the minimal amount of a given initial portfolio allowing any agent to reach the claim by trading, and give a dual representation of it as the largest proportion of the market price necessary for all agents to reach the same expected utility level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Specifically, all agents hand their individual losses over to a pool and each of them is liable for the conditional expectation of his own loss given the total loss of the pool. We call this risk sharing mechanism the conditional mean risk sharing. If all the conditional expectations involved are non-decreasing functions of the total loss then the conditional mean risk sharing is shown to be Pareto-optimal. Explicit expressions for the individual contributions to the pool are derived in some special cases of interest: independent and identically distributed losses, comonotonic losses, and mutually exclusive losses. In particular, conditions under which this payment rule leads to a comonotonic risk sharing are examined. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 51, 265-270] proposed the conditional mean risk sharing rule to allocate the total risk among participants to an insurance pool. This paper relates the conditional mean risk sharing rule to the size-biased transform when pooled risks are independent. A representation formula is first derived for the conditional expectation of an individual risk given the aggregate loss. This formula is then exploited to obtain explicit expressions for the contributions to the pool when losses are modeled by compound Poisson sums, compound Negative Binomial sums, and compound Binomial sums, to which Panjer recursion applies. Simple formulas are obtained when claim severities are homogeneous. A couple of applications are considered: first, to a peer-to-peer insurance scheme where participants share the first layer of their respective risks while the higher layer is ceded to a (re)insurer; second, to survivor credits to be shared among surviving participants in tontine schemes.},

 abstract = {Any financial asset that is openly traded has a market price. Except for extreme market conditions, market price may be more or less than a “fair” value. Fair value is likely to be some complicated function of the current intrinsic value of tangible or intangible assets underlying the claim and our assessment of the characteristics of the underlying assets with respect to the expected rate of growth, future dividends, volatility, and other relevant market factors. Some of these factors that affect the price can be measured at the time of a transaction with reasonably high accuracy. Most factors, however, relate to expectations about the future and to subjective issues, such as current management, corporate policies and market environment, that could affect the future financial performance of the underlying assets. Models are thus needed to describe the stochastic factors and environment, and their implementations inevitably require computational finance tools.},

 abstract = {Despite well-known shortcomings as a risk measure, Value-at-Risk (VaR) is still the industry and regulatory standard for the calculation of risk capital in banking and insurance. This paper is concerned with the numerical estimation of the VaR for a portfolio position as a function of different dependence scenarios on the factors of the portfolio. Besides summarizing the most relevant analytical bounds, including a discussion of their sharpness, we introduce a numerical algorithm which allows for the computation of reliable (sharp) bounds for the VaR of high-dimensional portfolios with dimensions d possibly in the several hundreds. We show that additional positive dependence information will typically not improve the upper bound substantially. In contrast higher order marginal information on the model, when available, may lead to strongly improved bounds. Several examples of practical relevance show how explicit VaR bounds can be obtained. These bounds can be interpreted as a measure of model uncertainty induced by possible dependence scenarios. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

An accurate, efficient and practical algorithm is given for calculating cumulative probabilities and excess pure premiums. The input re-quired is the claim severity and claim count distributions. One of the main drawbacks of the collective risk model is the uncertainty of the parameters of the claim severity and claim count distributions. Modifi-cations of the collective risk model are proposed to deal with these problems. These modifications are incorporated into the algorithm. Examples are given illustrating the use of this algorithm. They include (1) calculating the pure premium for a policy with an aggregate limit; (2) calculating the pure premium of an aggregate stop-loss policy for group life insurance; and (3) calculating the insurance charge for a multi-line retrospective rating plan, including a line which is itself subject to an aggregate limit.},

We argue that there is a need to adopt a standard definition for sample quantiles so that the same answers are produced by different packages and within each package.

@article{Jewson2022,
 abstract = {There is great interest in trying to understand how to take climate model projections of possible changes in hurricane behaviour due to climate change and apply them to hurricane risk models. In Knutson et al. (Bull Am Meteorol Soc 101:E303–E322, 2020), projections from many climate models were combined to form distributions of possible changes in hurricane frequency and intensity. It has been shown that propagating the uncertainty represented by these distributions is necessary to estimate the impact on risk correctly. Building on these results, we now consider how distributions of changes in hurricane frequency and intensity can be applied to hurricane risk models that are formulated in the standard event loss table and year loss table formats. Because of the uncertainty, this requires the use of novel simulation and weighting techniques that extend standard methods for adjusting risk models. We demonstrate that these novel techniques work in a simple hurricane risk model. We also present new analytical solutions that show how means and variances of risk change due to the application of uncertain adjustments. Finally, we use emulators to explore how the output from just a single evaluation of a hurricane risk model can be used to derive sensitivity estimates that would otherwise require a large number of evaluations of the model. The methods we present could readily be applied to full complexity hurricane risk models and will hopefully contribute to efforts to quantify the possible effects of climate change on present and future hurricane risk.},

It provides a link to the further theoretical study of actuarial science. The methods presented can not only be used in non-life insurance, but are also effective in other branches of actuarial science, as well as, of course, in actuarial practice. Apart from the standard theory, this text contains methods directly relevant for actuarial practice, for example the rating of automobile insurance policies, premium principles and riskmeasures, and IBNR models.Also, the important actuarial statis- tical tool of the Generalized Linear Models is studied. These models provide extra possibilities beyond ordinary linear models and regression, the statistical tools of choice for econometricians. Furthermore, a short introduction is given to credibil- ity theory. Another topic that always has enjoyed the attention of risk theoreticians is the study of ordering of risks. The book reflects the state of the art in actuarial risk theory; many results presented were published in the actuarial literature only recently. In},

It is argued that the allocation of the portfolio measure to the financial derivative takes the usual form of (distortion-) weighted “co-measure” expectation. Due to homogeneity, the allocation of the derivative's value to further subcomponents (ultimately, the primitive elements of the portfolio), following Aumann-Shapley, is the exposure gradient. However, the gradient in this case consists of two terms. The first is the familiar distorted expectation of the gradient of the component with respect to the subcomponent. The second term involves the conditional covariance of the component with the subcomponent. Sufficient conditions for this second term to vanish are provided. A method for estimating the second component in a simulation framework is proposed.},

 abstract = {We analyze multiline pricing and capital allocation in equilibrium no-arbitrage markets. Existing theories often assume a perfect complete market, but when pricing is linear, there is no diversification benefit from risk pooling and therefore no role for insurance companies. Instead of a perfect market, we assume a non-additive distortion pricing functional and the principle of equal priority of payments in default. Under these assumptions, we derive a canonical allocation of premium and margin, with properties that merit the name the natural allocation. The natural allocation gives non-negative margins to all independent lines for default-free insurance but can exhibit negative margins for low-risk lines under limited liability. We introduce novel conditional expectation measures of relative risk within a portfolio and use them to derive simple, intuitively appealing expressions for risk margins and capital allocations. We give a unique capital allocation consistent with our law invariant pricing functional. Such allocations produce returns that vary by line, in contrast to many other approaches. Our model provides a bridge between the theoretical perspective that there should be no compensation for bearing diversifiable risk and the empirical observation that more risky lines fetch higher margins relative to subjective expected values.},

Actuarial Geometry studies how the shape of an aggregate loss distribution changes as expected loss volume changes. The theory of Markov processes implies Levy processes are straight lines even though their distribution changes shape as expected losses increase. In contrast, an asset-return model retains a constant shape but represents a curved path. The difference is significant in the theory of risk measures and capital allocation, which are based on marginal changes in loss volume. In the figure the Levy process (red) is a great circle straight line whereas the asset model (blue) is a curved path. Growth along the two paths results in different measures of marginal risk (top right).},

@article{Phillips1998,
 abstract = {This paper uses a contingent claims framework to develop a financial pricing model of insurance that overcomes one of the main shortcomings of previous models - the inability to price insurance by line in a multiple line insurer subject to default risk. The model predicts prices will vary across firms depending upon firm default risk, but within a given insurer prices should not vary after controlling for line-specific liability growth rates. We also analyze an important qualification to this result for insurance groups, where several insurer subsidiaries are owned by a primary insurer or holding company. Empirical tests using data on publicly traded property-liability insurers support the hypotheses: prices vary across firms depending upon overall-firm default risk and the concentration of business among subsidiaries; but within a given firm, prices do not vary by line after adjusting for line-specific liability growth rates.},

@article{Rockafellar2014b,
 abstract = {Random variables can be described by their cumulative distribution functions, a class of nondecreasing functions on the real line. Those functions can in turn be identified, after the possible vertical gaps in their graphs are filled in, with maximal monotone relations. Such relations are known to be the subdifferentials of convex functions. Analysis of these connections yields new insights. The generalized inversion operation between distribution functions and quantile functions corresponds to graphical inversion of monotone relations. In subdifferential terms, it corresponds to passing to conjugate convex functions under the LegendreFenchel transform. Among other things, this shows that convergence in distribution for sequences of random variables is equivalent to graphical convergence of the monotone relations and epigraphical convergence of the associated convex functions. Measures of risk that employ quantiles (VaR) and superquantiles (CVaR), either individually or in mixtures, are illuminated in this way. Formulas for their calculation are seen from a perspective that reveals how they were discovered. The approach leads further to developments in which the superquantiles for a given distribution are interpreted as the quantiles for an overlying superdistribution. In this way a generalization of KoenkerBasset error is derived which lays a foundation for superquantile regression as a higher-order extension of quantile regression.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Mathematical Optimization Society (outside the USA).},

The main purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the main approaches that can be followed when developing a suitable stochastic optimization model.

 abstract = {The Aumann-Shapley [Values of Non-atomic Games, Princeton University Press, Princeton] value, originating in cooperative game theory, is used for the allocation of risk capital to portfolios of pooled liabilities, as proposed by Denault [Coherent allocation of risk capital, J. Risk 4 (1) (2001) 1]. We obtain an explicit formula for the Aumann-Shapley value, when the risk measure is given by a distortion premium principle [Axiomatic characterisation of insurance prices, Insur. Math. Econ. 21 (2) (1997) 173]. The capital allocated to each instrument or (sub)portfolio is given as its expected value under a change of probability measure. Motivated by Mirman and Tauman [Demand compatible equitable cost sharing prices, Math. Oper. Res. 7 (1) (1982) 40], we discuss the role of Aumann-Shapley prices in an equilibrium context and present a simple numerical example. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This premium principle is scale invariant and additive for layers.

@article{Wilson2016,
 abstract = {A novel method is presented for fast convolution of a pair of probability mass functions defined on a finite lattice with guaranteed accuracy of all computed values. This method, called aFFT-C (accurate FFT convolution), utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for the gain in speed, but relying on a rigorous analysis of the propagation of roundoff error, it can detect and circumvent the accumulation of this numerical error that is otherwise inherent to the Fourier transform. In the worst case scenario aFFT-C's execution time is on par with the accurate naive convolution but in a typical application it is comparable with a direct FFT-based convolution (FFT-C). The properties of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated both theoretically and empirically.},

@article{Woo2002,
 abstract = {The procedure for estimating probable maximum loss (PML) for natural catastrophes has evolved over the past few decades from a rather simplistic deterministic basis to a more sophisticated methodology based on loss exceedance probability curves, generated using catastrophe modelling software. This development process is reviewed, with an emphasis on the earthquake peril, which, because of its widespread threat to critical industrial installations, has been at the forefront of most PML advances. The coherent risk definition of PML is advocated as an improvement over standard quantile methods, which can give rise to anomalous aggregation results failing to satisfy the fundamental axiom of subadditivity, and so discouraging the pooling of risks.},
